===== OpenJPA

When deploying multiple Syncope <<core>> instances with a single database or database cluster, it is of
fundamental importance that the contained OpenJPA instances are correctly configured for
http://openjpa.apache.org/builds/2.4.2/apache-openjpa/docs/ref_guide_event.html[remote event notification^]. +
Such configuration, in fact, allows the OpenJPA data cache to remain synchronized when deployed in multiple JVMs, thus
enforcing data consistency across all Syncope Core instances.

Replace

....
classpath*:/coreContext.xml
classpath*:/securityContext.xml
classpath*:/logicContext.xml
classpath*:/restCXFContext.xml
classpath*:/persistenceContext.xml
classpath*:/provisioning*Context.xml
classpath*:/workflow*Context.xml
....

with

....
classpath*:/coreContext.xml
classpath*:/securityContext.xml
classpath*:/logicContext.xml
classpath*:/restCXFContext.xml
classpath:/persistenceContext.xml
classpath*:/provisioning*Context.xml
classpath*:/workflow*Context.xml
....

in `core/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml`.

Download
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/core/persistence-jpa/src/main/resources/persistenceContext.xml[persistenceContext.xml^]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/tree/2_0_X/core/persistence-jpa/src/main/resources/persistenceContext.xml[persistenceContext.xml^]
endif::[]
and
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "release"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/blob/syncope-{docVersion}/core/persistence-jpa/src/main/resources/domains.xml[domains.xml^]
endif::[]
ifeval::["{snapshotOrRelease}" == "snapshot"]
https://github.com/apache/syncope/tree/2_0_X/core/persistence-jpa/src/main/resources/domains.xml[domains.xml^]
endif::[]
then save both under `core/src/main/resources/`.

The default configuration in `domains.xml` is

[source,xml]
....
<entry key="openjpa.RemoteCommitProvider" value="sjvm"/>
....

which is suited for single JVM installations; with multiple instances, more options like as TCP or JMS are available;
see the OpenJPA documentation for reference.

[WARNING]
====
The http://openjpa.apache.org/builds/2.4.2/apache-openjpa/docs/ref_guide_event.html[OpenJPA documentation^]'s XML
snippets refer to a different configuration style; for example, when used in `domains.xml`, this:

[source,xml]
....
<property name="openjpa.RemoteCommitProvider" value="tcp(Addresses=10.0.1.10;10.0.1.11)"/>
....

becomes:

[source,xml]
....
<entry key="openjpa.RemoteCommitProvider" value="tcp(Addresses=10.0.1.10;10.0.1.11)"/>
....

===== Quartz

The http://www.quartz-scheduler.org[Quartz^] scheduler is largely used within Syncope <<core>> to schedule the execution
of jobs, including <<tasks-pull,pull>>, <<tasks-push,push>>, <<tasks-notification,notification>> and 
<<tasks-custom,custom>> tasks, and <<reportlets,reportlets>>.

By default, Quartz is configured for
http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/documentation/quartz-2.2.x/configuration/ConfigJDBCJobStoreClustering.html[clustering^],
where each node is automatically handled via the underlying JDBC store, and all cluster nodes are equally selectable
for processing jobs.

There are deployment scenarios which might have different requirements: for example, there could be three Core nodes
configured with OpenJPA remote commit provider (see above), where two of them are dedicated to serve REST requests,
leaving the third for running Quartz jobs.

In such cases, it is possible to prevent Quartz from running on a given node by setting the following parameter in
`core/src/main/resources/provisioning.properties`:

....
quartz.disableInstance=true
....
